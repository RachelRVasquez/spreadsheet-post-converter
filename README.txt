This is a code sample of something Rachel has built before, but a smaller plugin version.

== Description ==

This is a code sample of Rachel's where she is using PHP Spreadsheet to upload a sample "account code" excel file and converting the file's data to custom post types, custom taxonomies and post meta.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `spreadsheet-post-converter` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Navigate to the "Convert Spreadsheet" menu item on the Admin
1. Upload your spreadsheet from there. Helpful tip: Keep the console log/Network tab in your browser open.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this ready for public use? =

Nope. It's only for Rachel to demo her code. Don't fork this. It can be used as a reference, but not dynamic enough where spreadsheet options are customizable yet.
